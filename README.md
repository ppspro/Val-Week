## 🎯 Customization Tips

### To Create More Day Pages:
1. Copy `days/rose.html` as a template
2. Change the body class (e.g., `class="propose-day"`)
3. Update the content, messages, and quotes
4. The styling is already responsive and will adapt!

### To Change Colors:
Edit the CSS variables in `styles.css` or `day-styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --rose-pink: #ff6b9d;
    --deep-pink: #c44569;
    --accent: #ff1744;
    /* Add your custom colors */
}
```

### To Add More Quotes:
In each day's HTML file, add more quote divs:
```html
<div class="quote">
    <p>"Your custom quote here"</p>
</div>
```
